// This is the public EC key of the SP. The corresponding private EC key is
// used by the SP to sign data used in the remote attestation SIGMA protocol
// to sign channel binding data in MSG2. A successful verification of the
// signature confirms the identity of the SP to the ISV app in remote
// attestation secure channel binding. The public EC key should be hardcoded in
// the enclave or delivered in a trustworthy manner. The use of a spoofed public
// EC key in the remote attestation with secure channel binding session may lead
// to a security compromise. Every different SP the enlcave communicates to
// must have a unique SP public key. Delivery of the SP public key is
// determined by the ISV. The TKE SIGMA protocl expects an Elliptical Curve key
// based on NIST P-256
